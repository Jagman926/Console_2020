# Console Programming (Spring 2020)
Repository for Console Programming VR/UI project

## About Project
This project was created for the Console Programming class taught at Champlain college. The intent is to create a system, tool, or application for non-standard PC purposes.
I chose to work in VR as my current production game *Cash Force* is being done in Unreal VR and I wanted to get more hands on with VR and other development pipelines I'm not
as familiar with. Creating UI in general is a territory I have experience in from past projects/games, but have not been able to go in depth on, especially in Unreal. I will
be blogging on my progress with this project over at my [website][1] where you can learn more about my process and development updates on [Exploring UI & VR][2]!
